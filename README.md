# JS Frameworks Course Assignment

This project was to learn how to use JS Frameworks. I've chosen Next.js.
It was used to learn how to make API calls, create dynamic routes and make form validation.

## Description

In this project I'm making an API call with a JS Framework of my own choosing. I chose Next.js to fetch Mojito recipes and try to display them on a separate page.
I've also created two forms and added validation to them using components.
